# Tasks For Codsoft  (DataSet for All is given in the pdf or you can go check kaggle)
## 1.
## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains information about various credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, merchant category, and transaction time.
## Approach
We experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The steps involved in building the model include:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features, etc.
2. Model training: Training the machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset.
3. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Model selection: Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
5. Model deployment: Deploying the selected model for real-time fraud detection.

## 2.
## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. The model utilizes techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
## Requirements
Python (version X.X)
Libraries:
scikit-learn
numpy
pandas
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Implementation
1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and tokenizing the text data, removing stopwords, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
2.Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF or word embeddings to represent the textual information as numerical features.
3.Model Training: Training classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM on the extracted features.
4.Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## 3.
## Overview
This project focuses on building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. We utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF and word embeddings, and implement classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to identify spam messages.

## Introduction
The proliferation of spam messages has necessitated the development of automated systems to detect and filter out spam. This project builds a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate, enhancing the security and efficiency of SMS communication.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves several steps to clean and prepare the text data for analysis:
1.Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, punctuation, and numbers.
2.Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
3.Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
4.Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute to the meaning of the text.
5.Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.

## Feature Extraction
1.TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
2.TF-IDF is used to transform the text data into numerical features, representing the importance of words in the context of the entire dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated to identify the best-performing model:
1.Naive Bayes: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
2.Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
3.Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
1.Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified messages.
2.Precision: The proportion of true positive results among all positive results.
3.Recall: The proportion of true positive results among all actual positive cases.
4.F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
