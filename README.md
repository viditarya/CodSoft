# Fraud Detection Model for Credit Card Transactions

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains information about various credit card transactions, including features such as transaction amount, merchant category, and transaction time.
## Approach
We experimented with multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests

## Implementation
The project is implemented in Python using popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The steps involved in building the model include:
1. Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features, etc.
2. Model training: Training the machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset.
3. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Model selection: Selecting the best-performing model based on evaluation results.
5. Model deployment: Deploying the selected model for real-time fraud detection.
